##### **Description**
In this web app, users will be able to access a database of video games created by gamers FOR gamers.
In very much the same way that users acces Yelp to add unique reviews to places they've been or sampled, so shall gamers be able to do the same with games they've played!
***
Users can see which games are exclusive to which consoles, and players can even leave reviews to encourage or discourage other players to play or not play certain games!
User credentials allow Official IGDB Players to add new games to the database for all to see!

Games will be displayed with Release Date information alongisde their levels of console exclusivity/availability!
Pending release dates from one console to availability elsewhere will be shown too, for those players who just can't afford to have it all and want to try new games that are just out of reach presently.

Like Yelp, the breadth of reviews for each game are meant to both help players dive further down their preferred gaming genre rabbits holes and perhaps steer the potential peeking game devs in the right direction to best satisfy the players!
